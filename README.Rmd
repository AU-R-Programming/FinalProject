[Package Repository: FinalProject](https://github.com/AU-R-Programming/FinalProject)

<<<<<<< HEAD
The package is called "lmG1" under the "FinalProject" repository. The package is designed to perform linear regression. You can see lmG1 in action at https://github.com/AU-R-Programming/FinalProject, which has the latest version of lmG1.
The package can be download by using "devtools::install_github("AU-R-Programming/lmG1")"function. 
=======
The package is called "lmG1" under the "FinalProject" repository. The package is designed to perform linear regression where the parameter vector $\beta$ is estimated using optimization. You can see lmG1 in action at https://github.com/AU-R-Programming/FinalProject.

There are two variables need to be initialized: 

    `x`: response variable, which is a vector of dimension n Ã— p.
    
    `y`: predictor variable of interest, a matrix that we want to predict.

We are using the `crop.data.csv` as our example dataset. 

```{r}
devtools::install_github("AU-R-Programming/FinalProject")
library(lmG1)
crop.data<- read.csv("crop.data.csv", header = TRUE)

X<- cbind(as.factor(crop.data$density, crop.data$block, crop.data$fertilizer))
y<- crop$yield
result<- lmG1(y, X, alpha = 0.05, plot = TRUE)
result
```
